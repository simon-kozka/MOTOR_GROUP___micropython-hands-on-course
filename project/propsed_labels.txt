#basics
[unlabeled] - motor stop
working - motor is spinning normally at 75% pwm
impact - motor impacted something and has trouble spinning back up to speed
imbalance - motor spinning an uneven weight or similar

#bonus features that might be implemented in the future:
spin-up - smooth motor start using pwm
spin-down - smooth motor stop using pwm
grinding - motor bearing worn out (dust and dirt inside of the motor)
accident - motor collides with a person (triggered by shouting and screaming)
