# MicroPython & Edge AI Hands-On Course

## Getting Started

### Working with this Repository

This repository is the starting point for your work and points to various resources that will help you throughout the projects.

Each team should create one [Fork](https://github.com/Infineon/micropython-hands-on-course/fork) of this repository to work on the projects. Please share the location of your fork with the course instructors.

Please use the directories below to organize your work:
- `./project/deepcraft_workspace` - Your DEEPCRAFT™ Studio workspace, containing your project files, data, models.
- `./project/micropython` - Your documented MicroPython application code and related files (such as custom modules).
- `./report/` - Your project report & final presentation.

Please actively use git commits to document your progress and regularly push your changes to your forked repository. If you do not want to share your progress with other teams, please make your forked repository private and invite the course instructors as collaborators.
